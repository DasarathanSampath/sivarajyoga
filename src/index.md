"In yoga , theory and practice, as well as left brain and right brain, go hand in hand so to speak. Study (svâdhyâya) is in fact an important aspect of many branches and schools of Yoga. This is another way in which Yoga’s balanced approach shows itself. In yoga, theory and practice, as well as left brain and right brain, go hand in hand so to speak. Study (svâdhyâya) is in fact an important aspect of many branches and schools of Yoga. This is another way in which Yoga’s balanced approach shows itself. If you want to know where something is going, it is good to know where it came from. “To be ignorant of what happened before one was born,” said Cicero pointedly in his Orator, “is to remain ever a child.” History provides context and meaning, and Yoga is no exception to this rule. If you are fond of history, you’ll enjoy what follows. Many of the facts and ideas presented here have not yet found their way into the textbooks or even into most Yoga books. We put you in touch with the leading edge of knowledge in this area. If you are not a history buff, well, perhaps we can tempt you to suspend your preferences for a few minutes and read on anyway.

# Yoga in Scriptures (Sanskrit)

Patanjali's Yoga Sutra which outlines the sovereign path of Raja Yoga, is composed of a total of 196 sutras or aphorisms. These sutras are structured around four padas or chapters:

 - Samadhi Pada
 - Sadhana Pada
 - Vibhuti Pada

## Kaivalya Pada.

The first chapter, which is composed of 51 sutras, contemplates on the absolute true consciousness or Isvara and delineates the problems an individual soul is likely to face in its quest to merge with this Divine Soul.
yogas citta-vrtti-nirodhah...(Sutras 2) -yoga is the restraint of fluctuations of the mind
tasya api nirodhe sarva-nirodhan nirbijah samadhin...(Sutras 51) -whith even that restricted, everything is restricted and that is seedless samadhi.

## Sadhana Pada

After chapter one describes the different kinds of thought forms, practices to control them and the different kinds of samadhis culminating in the highest experience of nirbija samadhi, the second chapter follows it up with practical ways of attaining that state. tap ah-svadhyaya-isvara-pranidhani kriya-yoga... (Sutras 1) -Austerity, self-study, and dedication to isvara are kriya yoga. tath parama vasyathu indriyanam...(Sutras 55) -Then arises utmost command of the senses.

## Vibhuti Pada

This chapter deals with the subtle states of awareness and advanced techniques of practicing samyama. The various kinds of knowledge or siddhis that might be obtained by practicing this yogic technique are also described. The Pada brings home the fact that knowledge is power and states the techniques of utilizing such potency for the best possible results. desa-bandhas cittasya dharana...(Sutras 1)
-Concentration of the mind is [its] binding to a place.
sattava-purusayoh suddhi-sumye kaivalyam iti...(Sutras 55)
-In the sameness of purity between the sattva and the purusa there is kaivalyam.

## Kaivalya Pada

Kaivalya, which is the ultimate goal of yoga, means solitariness or detachment. The 34 sutras of the fourth chapter deals with impressions left by our endless cycles of birth and the rationale behind the necessity of erasing such impressions
janma-osadhi-mantra-tapah-samadhi-jah-siddayah...(Sutras 1) -Perfections are born due to birth, drugs, mantra, austerity, or samadhi. purusa-artha-sunyanam gunanam pratiprasavah kaivalyam svarupa-pratistha va citi-saktir iti...(Sutras 34) -The return to the origin of the gunas, emptied of their purpose for purusa is kaivalyam, the steadfastness in own form, and the power of higher awarness.
