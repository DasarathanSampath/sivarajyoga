Our body comprises five elements (sky, air, fire, water, and earth). Along with this, the three guilts, vaadham (rheumatism), piththam(bile), and kabam(sputum) are also evolving with our bodies. Therefore, the natural treatment with the help of five elements given for the diseases caused by the above said guilts is called naturopathy.

        Sky- Fasting therapy 
        Air - Prana therapy 
        Fire - Solar therapy
        Water-Water treatment 
        Land - Soil treatment 

Yoga, Varma, herb, fruit, stem, and oil are considered the evolution of five elements. Along with this, naturopathy directly uses leaves and panchakavviyam (milk, yogurt, ghee, cow urine, and cow dung).
