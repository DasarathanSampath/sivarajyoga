The word "Bhramari" comes from the sanskrit name bhramar which is Humming black bee. The practice of bhramari breathing calms the mind, reduces the stress or fight - flight response. It reduces celebral tensions, anger, anxiety, insomnia, The blood pressure is also lowered. This pranayama is very effective in speeding up the healing of body tissues and may be practiced after surgeries.

The purpose of the Bhramari breathing is to reduce throat ailments. This may have positive effect on the endocrine glands specially thyroids and nervous system. In ancient text of Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Swami Swatmaram says that person becomes Lord of Yogis and mind gets absorbed in the supreme bliss. It has a calming effect on entire nervous system, especially it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which induces muscular relaxation and is very effective in stress management. So this pranayama is very effective for relaxation of body and mind.

In this pranayama one needs to create a sound while exhaling and inhaling in the throat. The sound is similar to chanting of Om, especially the long mmm.. in Omkar. The sound should be deep, steady and smooth

### Practice - Note (Practice of Bhramari breathing should be done with a Yoga Expert Only)

Beginners can start with deep breathing practice in sitting position (Padmasana - Lotus, Swastikasana- Auspicious, Vajrasana - Thunderbolt, Any Cross legged position in which the body can be relaxed and spine is erect.)

Then start inhaling through both nostrils, and then start creating sound while you exhale.

Initially 4 seconds inhale through both nostrils while creating sound while exhaling for 6 seconds through both nostrils, this can be practiced for about 5 minutes.

With practice one can increase the counts to 4:8, or 5:10 or 6:12 seconds

Once the exhalation sound is mastered, one can start trying to create similar sound while inhaling. The inhalation sound is very difficult, but is possible with constant efforts.

## Precautions

You may feel little cold or tingling sensation in the throat due to sound but this is normal.

Under No circumstances the proportion of the breathing should be forced.

If you feel dizzy then please stop the practice and continue normal breathing.
