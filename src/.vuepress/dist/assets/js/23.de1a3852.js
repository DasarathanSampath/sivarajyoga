Hence, the rechaka is not prolonged and more air also is not exhaled. In day to day life, we exhale approximately 500 to 600 CC air per exhalation. During the Kapalbhati process, approximately 40 to 50 cc more air i.e. 550 to 650 cc air is expelled. This shows that exhaling more air is not expected during the process.

It is not perfect and may not be strictly adhered to. It is not possible to adhere to it strictly.
